# ‚ùì Introduction

This data science project focuses on **ARIMA Modelling, LSTM and Signal Processing** for Stock Prices. In this project, we analyse the S&P 500 Stock Prices, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S.

# üìö Breakdown

### Overview:
In this project, we will do the following:

1. Literature review and data collection (Part I)
2. Time-series modelling using ARIMA (Part II) 
3. Preparing the dataset according to literature (Part III) 
4. Train LSTM model to predict stock price (Part IV)

# üöÄ Takeaways

- Practice ARIMA Modelling - Learnt about p,d and q terms
- Signal Processing
- Long Short Term Modelling
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- Measuring Accuracy of Models using metrics such as RMSE
